# **Solitaire Free Cell**

**Classic Solitaire with a Modern Twist!**

*Solitaire Free Cell* is a captivating card game that challenges your strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. With beautifully designed visuals and smooth gameplay, it offers endless hours of entertainment.

## **Game Overview**

The game uses a standard deck of **52 cards**, dealt face-up into **eight columns**:
- **Four columns** with **7 cards** each.
- **Four columns** with **6 cards** each.

The board also includes:
- **4 Free Cells**: Temporary spaces for holding cards (**each can hold only one card**).
- **4 Foundation Piles**: Spaces for collecting cards in ascending order, starting with Ace and ending with King.

### **Unique Visual Style**
Our design includes:
- **Wooden Stand Cells**: Cards placed here cannot be moved back to columns.
- **Vine-Enclosed Cells**: Highlight your progress toward completing the foundations.

## **How to Play**

- **Move Cards Between Columns**: Cards can be moved in **descending order**, alternating colors (e.g., a black six can be placed on a red seven).
- **Using Free Cells**: Move any card to a free cell as a temporary holding place.
- **Building Foundations**: To move cards to foundation piles, start with an **Ace** and continue in **suit order** up to the King.
- **Super Moves**: Use free cells and empty columns to move multiple cards in sequence. The more free cells and empty columns available, the larger the sequence you can move at once.

The game has the ability to create a game by setting it to seed, so players can grain and play the same game.

## **Winning the Game**

Your goal is to move all cards from the columns and free cells to the foundation piles. You win when all cards are organized into their respective suits.

If a player passes a game he has already passed before, he will get less experience points. A small amount of experience is also awarded for losing.

## **Competitions**

After the player wins the game, he will be offered to make a post with his time results for additional experience points. Other players will be able to try to beat the time record and get experience and a visual upgrade of the playing card level. There are 5 levels in total. Each next level opens when the previous one is completed. That is, the player needs to beat 52 time records to start getting upgrades of the next level. These visual upgrades are to show the player how cool he is.

In a competitive game a player can win or lose only once, after that the post will display the corresponding text about winning or losing. Also displayed is the total number of players who were able to pass the time and who could not.
